<h1 style="background-color:lime;">The Same Thing From Different Angles</h1>
<p>The allegation is false that a fact taken from life, when recorded by the camera loses the right to be called a fact if its name, date, place, and number are not inscribed on the film.</p>
<p>Every instant of life shot unstaged, every individual frame shot just as it is in life with a hidden camera, "caught unawares," or by some other analogous technique-represents a fact recorded on film, a film-fact as we call it.</p>
<p>A dog running by on the street is a visible fact even if we don't catch up with it to read what's written on its collar.</p>
<p>An Eskimo on the screen remains an Eskimo even if he's not labeled "Nanook."</p>
<p>It would be completely absurd to try to have each individual shot (as a general rule) answer an entire questionnaire: where, when, why, date of birth, family situation, etc.</p>
<p>In a film archive, a storehouse, or museum where footage from current newsreels is kept in numbered chronological order, all the necessary data can be appended to each box of negatives, such as a detailed description of each film-fact, relevant newspaper clippings, biographical and other data.</p>
<p>This is necessary so that a film editor in constructing a film-object on a given theme will not make errors and mix up the facts in time or space.</p>
<p>In those films in which space is overcome by montage (for example, "workers of one country see those of another"), it's all the more essential that the editor take into account all data on the film footage to be organized.</p>
<p>But this does not in any way mean that the editor has to set forth all this data in the picture in the form of an information supplement to each shot or group of shots. This data only represents cover documents, as it were, for the editor, a kind of guide to the correct "editing route."</p>

<h1 style="background-color:lime;">Observations on the Long Take</h1>
<p>Consider the short sixteen-millimeter film of Kennedy's death. Shot by a
spectator in the crowd, it is a long take, the most typical long take imaginable.</p>
<p>The spectator-cameraman did not, in fact, choose his camera angle; he
simply filmed from where he happened to be, framing what he, not the lens, saw.1
Thus the typical long take is subjective.</p>
<p>In this, the only possible film of Kennedy's death, all other points of view are
missing: that of Kennedy and Jacqueline, that of the assassin himself and his
accomplices, that of those with a better vantage point, and that of the police
escorts, etc.</p>
<p>Suppose we had footage shot from all those points of view; what would we
have? A series of long takes that would reproduce that moment simultaneously
from various viewpoints, as it appeared, that is, to a series of subjectivities.
Subjectivity is thus the maximum conceivable limit of any audiovisual technique.
It is impossible to perceive reality as it happens if not from a single point of view,
and this point of view is always that of a perceiving subject. This subject is always
incarnate, because even if, in a fiction film, we choose an ideal and therefore
abstract and nonnaturalistic point of view, it becomes realistic and ultimately
naturalistic as soon as we place a camera and tape recorder there: the result will be
seen and heard as if by a flesh-and-blood subject (that is, one with eyes and ears).</p>
<p>Reality seen and heard as it happens is always in the present tense.</p>
<p>The long take, the schematic and primordial element of cinema, is thus in
the present tense. Cinema therefore "reproduces the present." Live television is a
paradigmatic reproduction of something happening in the present.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that we have not only one short film of Kennedy's death, but a
dozen such films, as many long takes as subjectively reproduce the President's
death. When, for example, for purely documentary reasons (during a screening for
a police investigation) we see all these subjective long takes in sequence, that is,
when we splice them, even if not materially, what do we have? A type of montage, albeit extremely elementary. And what do we get from this montage? A multiplication
of "presents," as if an action, instead of unwinding once before our eyes,
were to unwind many times. This multiplication of "presents" abolishes the
present, empties it, each present postulating the relativity of all others, their
unreliability, imprecision, and ambiguity.</p>
<p>For the police-who are least concerned with aesthetics and strongly
interested in the documentary value of the short film projected as eye-witness testimony
to an event that must be precisely reconstructed-the first question to ask is:
which of these films best represents the facts? There are so many unreliable eyes
and ears (or cameras and tape recorders) which record an irreversible event, one
which appears different to each of these natural organs or technical instruments
(shot, countershot, establishing shot, medium shot, close-up, and all other
possible camera positions). Each of these presentations of reality is extremely
impoverished, aleatory, almost pitiful, if one realizes that it is only one among
many.</p>
<p>It is clear that reality, in all its facets, is expressed in each: it speaks to those
present (to be present is to take part, because reality speaks only through itself): it
speaks its own language, which is the language of action: a gun shot, more gun
shots, a body falls, a car stops, a woman screams, the crowd shouts.... All these
nonsymbolic signs indicate that something happened: the death of a president,
here and now, in the present. And that present, I repeat, is the tense of the various
subjective long takes, shot from the various points of view where witnesses
happened to be with their organs or instruments.</p>
<p>The language of action is thus the language of nonsymbolic signs in the
present tense; but in the present it makes no sense, or if it does, it does so only
subjectively, in an incomplete, uncertain, mysterious way. Kennedy, dying,
expresses himself in his final action: falling and dying, on the seat of a black
presidential car, in the weak embrace of his American petit-bourgeois wife.</p>
<p>But this extreme language of action with which Kennedy is expressed to the
spectators remains indecisive and meaningless in the present in which it was
perceived by the senses and/or filmed. Like every moment of the language of
action, it requires something more. It requires systematization with regard to both
itself and the objective world; it must be related to other languages of action. In
this case, Kennedy's final actions need to be related to the actions of those at that
moment surrounding him, for example, to those of his assassin, or assassins.</p>
<p>As long as such actions remain unrelated, be it the language of Kennedy's
last action or that of his assassins, they are fragmentary and incomplete languages,
all but incomprehensible. What is needed to make them complete and comprehensible?
The relationship which each of them, groping and stammering, seeks with the others must be established. Not through a simple multiplication of presentsas in the juxtaposition of various subjective views-but through their coordination.
Unlike their juxtaposition, their coordination is not, in fact, limited to
destroying and emptying the concept of the present (as in the hypothetical
projection one after the other of the various films at FBI headquarters) but to
rendering the present past.</p>
<p>Only completed acts may be coordinated among themselves and thus acquire
meaning (as I will demonstrate later on).</p>
<p>For the moment let's suppose that among the detectives who have seen these
hypothetical films spliced end-to-end there is one with an ingenious analytical
mind. His ingenuity might show itself only in coordination. Intuiting the truth
from an attentive analysis of the various pieces, he could gradually reconstruct it
by choosing the truly significant moments of the various long takes, thereby
finding their real order. One has, simply, a montage. In the wake of such work of
choice and coordination, the various points of view would be dissolved and
subjectivity would give way to objectivity; the pitiful eyes and ears (or cameras and
recorders) which select and reproduce the fleeting and none too pleasant reality
would be replaced by a narrator, who transforms present into past.</p>
<p>The substance of cinema is therefore an endless long take, as is reality to our
senses for as long as we are able to see and feel (a long take that ends with the end
of our lives); and this long take is nothing but the reproduction of the language of
reality. In other words it is the reproduction of the present.</p>
<p>But as soon as montage intervenes, when we pass from cinema to film (they
are very different, just as langue is different from parole), the present becomes past:
a past that, for cinematographic and not aesthetic reasons, is always in the present
mode (that is, it is a historic present).</p>
<p>I must now tell you my thoughts about death (and I leave my skeptical
readers free to wonder what this has to do with cinema). I have said frequently,
and always poorly, that reality has its own language-better still, it is a
language-which, to be described, requires a general semiology, which at present
we do not possess, even as a notion (semiologists always observe distinct and
definite objects, that is, various existing languages, codified or not; they have not
yet discovered that semiology is the descriptive science of reality).</p>
<p>This language-I've said, and always badly-coincides with human action.
Man expresses himself above all through his action-not meant in a purely
pragmatic way-because it is in this way that he modifies reality and leaves his
spiritual imprint on it. But this action lacks unity, or meaning, as long as it
remains incomplete. While Lenin was alive, the language of his actions was still
in part indecipherable, because it remained in potentia, and thus modifiable by
eventual future actions. In short, as long as he has a future, that is, something
unknown, a man does not express himself. An honest man may at seventy commit
a crime: such blameworthy action modifies all his past actions, and he thus
presents himself as other than what he always was. So long as I'm not dead, no one will be able to guarantee he truly knows me, that is, be able to give meaning to my
actions, which, as linguistic moments, are therefore indecipherable.</p>
<p>It is thus absolutely necessary to die, because while living we lack meaning,
and the language of our lives (with which we express ourselves and to which we
attribute the greatest importance) is untranslatable: a chaos of possibilities, a
search for relations among discontinuous meanings. Death performs a lightningquick
montage on our lives; that is, it chooses our truly significant moments (no
longer changeable by other possible contrary or incoherent moments) and places
them in sequence, converting our present, which is infinite, unstable, and
uncertain, and thus linguistically indescribable, into a clear, stable, certain, and
thus linguistically describable past (precisely in the sphere of a general semiology).
It is thanks to death that our lives become expressive.</p>
<p>Montage thus accomplishes for the material of film (constituted of fragments,
the longest or the shortest, of as many long takes as there are subjectivities)
what death accomplishes for life.</p>
