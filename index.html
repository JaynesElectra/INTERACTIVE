  The allegation is false that a fact taken from life, when recorded by the camera loses the right to be called a fact if its name, date, place, and number are not inscribed on the film.
</p>
<p>
  Every instant of life shot unstaged, every individual frame shot just as it is in life with a hidden camera, "caught unawares," or by some other analogous technique-represents a fact recorded on film, a film-fact as we call it.
</p>
<p>
  A dog running by on the street is a visible fact even if we don't catch up with it to read what's written on its collar.
</p>
<p>
 An Eskimo on the screen remains an Eskimo even if he's not labeled "Nanook."
</p>
<p>
  It would be completely absurd to try to have each individual shot (as a general rule) answer an entire questionnaire: where, when, why, date of birth, family situation, etc.
</p>
<p>
  In a film archive, a storehouse, or museum where footage from current newsreels is kept in numbered chronological order, all the necessary data can be appended to each box of negatives, such as a detailed description of each film-fact, relevant newspaper clippings, biographical and other data.
</p>
<p>
  This is necessary so that a film editor in constructing a film-object on a given theme will not make errors and mix up the facts in time or space.
</p>
<p>
  In those films in which space is overcome by montage (for example, "workers of one country see those of another"), it's all the more essential that the editor take into account all data on the film footage to be organized.
</p>
<p>
  But this does not in any way mean that the editor has to set forth all this data in the picture in the form of an information supplement to each shot or group of shots. This data only represents cover documents, as it were, for the editor, a kind of guide to the correct "editing route."
