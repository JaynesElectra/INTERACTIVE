<h1>THE SAME THING FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES</h1>
<p>The allegation is false that a fact taken from life, 
when recorded by the camera loses the right to be calle
d a fact if its name, date, place, and number are not i
nscribed on the film.</p>
<p>Every instant of life shot unstaged, every individua
l frame shot just as it is in life with a hidden camera
, "caught unawares," or by some other analogous techniq
ue-represents a fact recorded on film, a film-fact as w
e call it.</p>
<p>A dog running by on the street is a visible fact eve
n if we don't catch up with it to read what's written o
n its collar.</p>
<p>An Eskimo on the screen remains an Eskimo even if he
's not labeled "Nanook."</p>
<p>It would be completely absurd to try to have each in
dividual shot (as a general rule) answer an entire ques
tionnaire: where, when, why, date of birth, family situ
ation, etc.</p>
<p>In a film archive, a storehouse, or museum where foo
tage from current newsreels is kept in numbered chronol
ogical order, all the necessary data can be appended to
each box of negatives, such as a detailed description o
f each film-fact, relevant newspaper clippings, biograp
hical and other data.</p>
<p>This is necessary so that a film editor in construct
ing a film-object on a given theme will not make errors
 and mix up the facts in time or space.</p>
<p>In those films in which space is overcome by montage
 (for example, "workers of one country see those of ano
ther"), it's all the more essential that the editor tak
e into account all data on the film footage to be organ
ized.</p>
<p>But this does not in any way mean that the editor ha
s to set forth all this data in the picture in the form
of an information supplement to each shot or group of s
hots. This data only represents cover documents, as it 
were, for the editor, a kind of guide to the correct "e
diting route."</p>
